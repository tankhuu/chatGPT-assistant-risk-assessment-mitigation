# Problem Statement
In today's fast-paced business environment, organizations are increasingly reliant on efficient risk management, seamless scheduling, and automated reporting to ensure a smooth and consistent customer experience. However, these functions are often disjointed and require significant manual intervention, leading to inefficiencies, increased operational  costs, and a heightened risk of errors or delays. Furthermore, traditional risk assessment methods lack the adaptability to manage real-time changes in customer needs, schedule fluctuations, and evolving risk profiles.

While large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown considerable potential in generating human-like text and offering interactive assistance, their utility in integrated solutions for risk assessment, proactive mitigation, and customer experience support remains largely unexplored. Leveraging the natural language processing capabilities of LLMs, there is an opportunity to develop a ChatGPT-based tool that can automate risk assessment, provide timely mitigative suggestions, and offer scheduling assistance with automated reporting. Such a tool could streamline complex tasks, reduce manual errors, and improve customer satisfaction by ensuring timely and effective responses to potential risks or scheduling conflicts.

The aim of this thesis is to investigate the design, development, and efficacy of an LLM-based system that integrates risk assessment and mitigation with customer scheduling, automated reporting, and time-sensitive support. This research seeks to answer whether such an integrated solution can effectively replace or augment current manual processes, thereby enabling organizations to deliver a more seamless and reliable customer experience.

The banking sector faces a unique set of challenges in risk management, customer service, and operational efficiency. Financial institutions must navigate complex regulatory environments, respond to rapidly evolving risk factors, and meet the high expectations of their clients for seamless, reliable service. Traditional risk assessment and mitigation processes in banks are often labor-intensive, prone to delays, and subject to human error, creating vulnerabilities that can impact both regulatory compliance and customer trust. Additionally, bank staff spend significant time on manual scheduling and reporting tasks, which detracts from their ability to provide timely and high-quality service to clients.

Advances in artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, offer a promising avenue for transforming these processes. However, there has been limited exploration into the development of a comprehensive LLM-based tool tailored to the banking sector that can integrate risk assessment and mitigation with automated reporting, time-sensitive support, and scheduling assistance. Such a solution has the potential to streamline routine tasks, proactively identify and mitigate risks, and improve the overall customer experience by ensuring timely and accurate responses to client needs and regulatory requirements.

This thesis aims to investigate and develop a ChatGPT-based tool designed for the banking industry that performs real-time risk assessment and mitigation, facilitates scheduling and time management, and generates automated reports. By leveraging the adaptability and natural language capabilities of LLMs, this tool seeks to address the operational inefficiencies and compliance risks in traditional banking processes. The research will assess whether an integrated LLM-based solution can reduce error rates, enhance compliance, and improve the customer experience by enabling faster, more accurate, and seamless service delivery.
