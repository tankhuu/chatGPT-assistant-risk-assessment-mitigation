Title
Developing a ChatGPT-Based System for Banking Risk Assessment and Mitigation

1. Introduction
Background: In the highly regulated and risk-sensitive banking sector, institutions face significant challenges in managing financial, operational, and regulatory risks. Current risk assessment processes are often labor-intensive, requiring extensive manual analysis and compliance checks. With advancements in artificial intelligence, Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown potential for transforming information-heavy tasks in finance, from analyzing patterns of risk to automating routine assessments.
Problem Statement: Despite the benefits, applying LLMs in banking requires careful consideration of specific challenges, including maintaining high accuracy, interpretability, regulatory compliance, and bias mitigation. The complexity of banking data and regulations adds layers of difficulty in implementing AI-based risk assessment tools.
Purpose of the Study: The project aims to develop a ChatGPT-based system tailored to support banking professionals in identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks by providing automated insights, risk analysis, and compliance recommendations.
2. Research Questions
Primary Research Question: How can a ChatGPT-based LLM be leveraged to effectively support risk assessment and mitigation in banking?
Secondary Questions:
Which specific banking risk scenarios can be effectively addressed by ChatGPT?
How can the ChatGPT model’s accuracy, interpretability, and reliability be ensured in the context of banking risk assessment?
What measures are required to mitigate model bias, especially for compliance and regulatory-sensitive recommendations?
How can real-time updates and feedback from banking professionals be integrated to refine the model’s accuracy and relevance?
3. Literature Review
AI and LLMs in Banking: Examine existing studies on AI applications in the banking sector, specifically focusing on risk assessment tools, compliance checks, fraud detection, and customer service automation. Highlight areas where LLMs have shown promise in improving risk-related workflows.
Challenges of LLMs in Risk Assessment: Review literature on the risks associated with deploying LLMs in sensitive applications, such as data security concerns, susceptibility to bias, interpretability issues, and regulatory compliance.
Bias and Compliance in AI for Finance: Summarize research on mitigating bias and maintaining compliance in financial applications of AI, including methods like prompt tuning, differential privacy, and fairness assessments.
4. Methodology
Model Selection and Customization:
Select an LLM, such as OpenAI’s GPT-4 or a similarly robust model. Justify the choice based on the model’s performance in handling complex language and specific banking terminologies.
Plan to fine-tune the model for banking-specific language, regulatory compliance terms, and risk-related queries by training it on datasets derived from banking reports, regulatory texts, compliance guidelines, and internal risk assessments.
Data Collection and Preparation:
Use data from sources like historical risk reports, audit findings, regulatory documents (e.g., Basel III, GDPR compliance), and anonymized transaction data for risk assessment.
Apply preprocessing steps such as data anonymization, categorization of risk events, and creation of labeled datasets to teach the model to recognize and interpret risk-related data.
System Architecture:
Design a system that includes the LLM backend for language understanding, a secure database to handle risk-related data, and a user-friendly interface for bank staff to interact with the model.
Include specific modules for:
Risk Query Interpretation: Allows the model to understand user questions related to risk.
Risk Categorization and Reporting: Generates automated summaries and reports on key risk indicators.
Bias Detection and Compliance Check: Ensures that the system’s recommendations are unbiased and adhere to regulatory standards.
Evaluation Strategy:
Define key performance metrics such as accuracy in risk detection, interpretability (ability for users to understand model reasoning), user satisfaction, and adherence to compliance guidelines.
Conduct expert validation by comparing the model’s recommendations with assessments by banking risk analysts.
Implement regular model audits to ensure continued compliance with regulatory changes and evolving risk factors.
5. Expected Outcomes
A prototype ChatGPT-based system tailored for banking risk assessment that can:
Answer user queries related to banking risks, analyze data for risk trends, and recommend mitigation actions.
Generate reports summarizing potential compliance or risk concerns, saving time and reducing manual oversight.
Provide an interface that banking professionals can use as a decision support tool, integrating expert feedback into ongoing model improvements.
Guidelines and recommendations for minimizing AI bias in banking risk assessment applications and ensuring compliance in an evolving regulatory landscape.
