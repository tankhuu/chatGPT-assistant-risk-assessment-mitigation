# problem statement

Risk Assessment and Mitigation are mandatory process in Banking, preventing and managing possible problems.It helps to identify potential risks and analyses consequences.
However, most of the traditional procedures for doing Risk Assessment and Mitigation take time, and resources, also cost, labor-intensive and the possibility of human mistakes.
Bank always has to deal with these things and manage their own risks even in the procedure of Risk Assessment and Mitigation.

In the era of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) is opening a new data-driven world of Technology, especially Large Language Models (LLM) and applying on Banking.
There're many LLM in the market both commercial & open-source which will be used in this project for the comparisons on the bias, on both quantitative & qualitative.
Traditional ML model like logistic regression, random forest, NNN will also be used to build the baselines for comparisons.

A better way to build a real-time support for Risk Evaluation, Assessment & Mitigation, increase Customers & Users Experience, which can be a very helpful assisstant supporting for automation of complicated & time-consuming tasks such as schedule calls, meetup, generate reports, ...
Knowledge will always be received & used, fine-tuning process & RAG will make more sense on quality improvement on the results for a specific domain like credit scoring, fraud detection, real-time risk analysis and reporting, and obviously, AI assistant can avoid human mistakes, It won't forget things, and always being on-time whenever you need.

As the power of LLMs which are the huge pre-trained models with more than 3 bilions of parameters (GPT-4o - updated 2024, ....), the ability to provide the realtime support, human-like questions & answers, with high accuracy, reliability. A long with the capability for fine-tuning with the specific domain knowledge, which will improve more on the quality of results

Aim

Currently, there're many researches for leveraging the capabilities of LLMs on many Domains like Medical, E-commerce, Finance, CyberSecurity, ... Banking is also investing on use LLMs for multiple approach like 
The aim of this research is to

Objectives

Develop a ChatGPT-based system which support to Risk assessment and mitigation, provide time support, automated reporting, and scheduling assistant to ensure smooth and seamless customer experience.
Design Methodologies by: 
 - Leveraging the power of LLM on wide-range of pre-trained data
 - Combining with specific banking dataset to run fine-tuning on mode
