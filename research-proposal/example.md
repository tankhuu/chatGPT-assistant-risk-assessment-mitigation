Research Proposal: Leveraging Large Language Models in Banking for Enhanced Customer Support and Risk Management
1. Introduction
Title: Enhancing Customer Support and Risk Management in Banking Using Large Language Models (LLMs)

Introduction:
The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) technologies has enabled banks to transform their operations. Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, have shown exceptional capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text. While LLMs are already being used for chatbots and customer support, there remains untapped potential in leveraging these models for specialized banking functions, such as automating customer inquiries, detecting fraudulent activities, and improving risk management.

This research aims to explore how LLMs can be optimized and fine-tuned for the banking sector to enhance customer interactions and proactively mitigate risks. The study will evaluate the impact of deploying LLMs on customer satisfaction, operational efficiency, and fraud detection.

2. Research Questions / Objectives
Research Questions:

How can LLMs improve customer support in the banking sector?
What are the challenges and risks of deploying LLMs for detecting fraud and managing risks?
How can LLMs be fine-tuned to understand domain-specific language, such as banking terminology and regulatory compliance?
Objectives:

To develop an LLM-based system that improves automated customer support, reducing response times and increasing customer satisfaction.
To explore the application of LLMs in identifying potential fraud by analyzing transaction data and customer communication.
To assess the ethical and regulatory implications of using LLMs in banking and ensure compliance with data privacy laws.
3. Literature Review
Banks are increasingly adopting AI and NLP technologies to streamline customer interactions and automate routine tasks (Smith & Patel, 2022). Studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of LLMs in answering general customer queries (Brown et al., 2020), but there is limited research on their application in specialized areas like fraud detection and risk management. Recent work by Li et al. (2023) shows promising results in using LLMs for real-time analysis of financial data, but challenges such as data privacy and model biases remain.

This research will build on existing studies by focusing on fine-tuning LLMs for banking-specific applications, ensuring compliance with industry standards while maintaining high accuracy in customer service and fraud detection.

4. Methodology
Approach:
This research will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative data analysis with qualitative insights from banking professionals.

Data Collection: A dataset will be compiled from anonymized customer inquiries, historical fraud cases, and transaction logs from a partner financial institution (with proper data privacy safeguards in place).
Model Fine-tuning: Pre-trained LLMs (like GPT-4) will be fine-tuned using domain-specific banking data to optimize understanding of financial terminology, regulatory requirements, and fraud indicators.
Evaluation Metrics: Performance will be measured using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for fraud detection, as well as customer satisfaction scores for automated support responses.
Ethical Analysis: A thorough analysis will be conducted to ensure that the LLMâ€™s outputs comply with GDPR and other relevant regulations, particularly in terms of data privacy and non-bias in automated decisions.

6. Expected Outcomes / Impact
The expected outcome of this research is the development of an optimized LLM that can significantly improve customer support efficiency and fraud detection in the banking industry. By automating routine inquiries, banks can enhance customer experience while reducing operational costs. Additionally, by leveraging LLMs for fraud detection, banks can proactively identify suspicious activities, potentially saving millions in losses due to fraud. This research could pave the way for safer, more efficient AI adoption in financial services.

7. Resources / Requirements
Access to anonymized banking datasets (customer inquiries, transaction histories, fraud cases).
Computing resources (e.g., high-performance GPUs) for model training and fine-tuning.
Software tools such as Python, PyTorch, and the Hugging Face Transformers library for model development.
Collaboration with banking professionals for qualitative insights and evaluation.
